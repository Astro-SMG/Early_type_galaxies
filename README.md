<em>Currently in preparation (Paper III</a>)...</em>

I present the previously described and presented Single Stellar Population synthesis models in the near-infrared (NIR) and their comparison with field and Fornax elliptical galaxies in the K band. The comparison is made in line-strength indices, integrated colours and full-spectrum fitting approaches.

The following is the proposed outline for this work:
<ul>
	<li>The data sample of early-type galaxies</li>
	<li>Single stellar population synthesis models</li>
	<li>Stellar population analysis</li>
	<li>Integrated colours and line strength indices</li>
	<li>Spectral energy distributions fittings</li>
	<li>Balancing single stellar population models and stars</li>
	<li>Inclusion of AGBs and RGBs</li>
	<li>Adding AGBs</li>
</ul>
